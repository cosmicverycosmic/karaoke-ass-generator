We are the carbon
That they want to reduce

They had their plandemic fun
Now they want the sun
They censored us
To cover their lies
Now they want to darken our skies
Can anybody tell me why?

Tearing down farms
Building bug factories
Putting up windmills
And burying trees
Mandating a kill switch
In all new cars
We will own nothing
So nothing's really ours

We are the carbon that they want to reduce

Going deep into debt to prop up a big green lie
Seems pretty obvious
They want us all to die
Watching all of this happen driving me insane
How can you just sit there
As our rights circle the drain

We are the carbon that they want to reduce

They had their plandemic fun
Now they want the sun
They censored us to cover their lies
Now they want to darken our skies
Can anybody tell me why?
